      <p>I am learning how to build a blog site by using Astro.</p>
      <p>I first heard about Astro while listening to my favorie podcast CodeNewbie.</p>
      <p>CodeNewbie is my favorite podcast because it is easy to digest and what I enjoy most is learning from the vast experiences from other developers within the industry.</p>

  } 
</ul>
