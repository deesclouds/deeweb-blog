## What I've learned:

I learned how to nest layouts and remove duplicated elements.

The component based-design system allows us to nest one layout inside of another and take advantage of a modular design system.

Multiple layouts are useful for projects that utilizes Markdown pages for projects like building a blog.

The BaseLayout.astro component allows for templating for all our pages.

Learned how to implement Astro API to work with my files and add functionality to the tags, index, and RSS feed.

Learned how to use the Astro.glob() for accessing data files within my project, how to use the getStaticPaths() to create multiple pages/routes all at once, and the Astro RSS package to create an RSS Feed.

It's fun learning how to do this by implementing blog archives.
