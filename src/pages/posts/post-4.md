## What I've learned:

I learned how to refractor my code to improve my existing code design by utilizing less code without changing the design appearance and achieved this by utilizing a reusable component.

Astro components are reusable and fragments of HTML code. The way to create a new file is by creating a new page ending with the '.astro' extension within the src/pages/ directory. 

I now know how to refractor my code by adding new and reusable components.
