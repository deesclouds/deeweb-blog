## What I've learned:

I learned how to nest layouts and remove duplicated elements.

The component based-design system allows us to nest one layout inside of another and take advantage of a modular design system.

Multiple layouts are useful for projects that utilizes Markdown pages for projects like building a blog.

The BaseLayout.astro component allows for templating for all our pages.
